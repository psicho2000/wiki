## TDD Laws

http://programmer.97things.oreilly.com/wiki/index.php/The_Three_Laws_of_Test-Driven_Development

1. Write *no* production code except to pass a failing test.
2. Write only *enough* of a test do demonstrate a failure.
3. Write only *enough* production code the test.

## Other rules

* Tests are first class citizens. Treat them as production code: clean.
* If there is need of a comment, refactor it.
